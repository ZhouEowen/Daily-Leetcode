# Question:
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:

Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)

## My answer:
Idea: traverse all the combination of three elements in the lists. First fix the first and the second elements, and begin to traverse the third element in the range of the remain elements in the list. Update the result if the new sum are closer than the old sum. Then change the second element, repeat the procedure; change the first element, repeat the procedure.
For example, nums=[1,2,3,4,5], target=1,
The traversing order is 
1,2,3; 1,2,4; 1,2,5; 
1,3,4; 1,3,5; 
1,4,5;
2,3,4; 2,3,5; 
2,4,5;
3,4,5

```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        sums=sum(nums[0:3])
        result=sums
        old_diff=abs(sums-target)
        for i in range(len(nums)-2):
            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)-1):
                for k in range(j+1,len(nums)):
                    sums=nums[i]+nums[j]+nums[k]
                    new_diff=abs(sums-target)
                    if new_diff<=old_diff:
                        result=sums
                        old_diff=new_diff
        return result
```

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()
        re_min = 0 #存储当前最小的差值
        
        for i in range(n):
            low = i+1
            high = n-1
            while low < high:
                three_sum = nums[i] + nums[low] + nums[high]
                x = target - three_sum #当前三数的差值
                if re_min == 0:
                    re_min = abs(x)
                    sum_min = three_sum #sum_min为当前最接近的和
                
                if abs(x) < re_min:
                    re_min = abs(x)
                    sum_min = three_sum
                
                if three_sum == target:
                    return target
                elif three_sum < target:
                    low += 1
                else:
                    high -= 1
        
        return sum_min
